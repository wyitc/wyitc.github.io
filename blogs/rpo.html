during a long car ride on the awful infinite corn-laden US I-55, i decided to relisten to this just to give myself ANY stimulus to latch onto. far be it from me to pretend i'm a noise music aficionado, but this one's TONS of fun. pretty funny too, sometimes unintentionally, other times definitely on purpose. certainly chaotic, but to call it totally random would be underselling its structure quite a bit.

it spends time building itself; you hear that in the opening, Red Mao Book By Sony, Paraiso 1, Kabukicho Conference... longer tracks with more room to develop, in an engaging way that always keeps the tension.

spends even MORE time destroying itself, toppling itself, in as many ways as it can think to do. you hear that in Crossing Frankfurt's focused drumming, which the entire song is built around, slowly and furiously spiraling away leaving everything else in the dust. you hear it in Rush Capture 1 as every bit of sound wages war for your earspace, unravelling and overlapping each other, and you hear it in the bizarro-land mirror image Rush Capture 2 later on, which sidesteps the more subtle (lol) approach and elects instead to melt your fucking face off. you hear it in Grand Pink Junction Ballad, which gives you, by my count, four seconds of smooth muzak before literally screaming in your ear.

you're never waiting for anything to happen, because RPO manages your expectations before you realize it's happening (and also because everything is happening, always, all of the time)
